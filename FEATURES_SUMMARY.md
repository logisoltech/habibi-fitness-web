### 3. **TDEE Results Page** (`/results/tdee`)
Comprehensive Total Daily Energy Expenditure calculator:

#### Metrics Displayed 📊
- **BMR** (Basal Metabolic Rate)
- **Activity Multiplier** (1.2x - 1.9x)
- **TDEE** (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

#### Calorie Recommendations 🍽️
**Weight Loss Goals:**
- Aggressive Cut (20% deficit) - ~0.9 kg/week
- Moderate Cut (10% deficit) - ~0.45 kg/week

**Maintenance:**
- Maintain current weight

**Weight Gain Goals:**

- Aggressive Bulk (15% surplus) - ~0.7 kg/week

#### Calculation Formula ✅
Uses **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**:
```
Men: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) + 5
Women: BMR = (10 × weight_kg) + (6.25 × height_cm) - (5 × age) - 161

TDEE = BMR × Activity_Multiplier
```
